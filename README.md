- **Real-time Dashboard**: Provides live analytics and operational insights

## 🚀 Quick Start

```python
from tix_agent import Tix, Agent, Customer

# Initialize Tix
tix = Tix()

# Register your support team
agent = Agent("agent_001", "Sarah Tech", ["technical", "billing"], max_capacity=10)
tix.register_agent(agent)

# Register customers for context-aware routing
customer = Customer("cust_001", tier="premium", history_count=5)
tix.register_customer(customer)

# Process incoming tickets with instant analysis
ticket, routing = tix.process_ticket(
    subject="Can't access my account",
    content="Been trying to login for an hour, getting errors",
    customer_id="cust_001",
    channel="email"
)

print(f"Priority: {ticket.priority.value}")
print(f"Route to: {routing.decision.value}")

## 📊 Core Components

### Ticket Intelligence
```python
@dataclass
class Ticket:
    id: str
    priority: Priority          # CRITICAL, HIGH, MEDIUM, LOW
    sentiment_score: float      # -1.0 to 1.0
    urgency_score: float       # 0.0 to 1.0
    complexity_score: float    # 0.0 to 1.0
    category: str              # technical, billing, account, etc.
    keywords: List[str]        # Extracted key terms
    similar_tickets: List[str] # Related ticket IDs
```

### Smart Routing
```python
@dataclass
class RoutingRecommendation:
    decision: RoutingDecision   # HUMAN_SPECIALIST, BOT_AUTOMATION, ESCALATE
    target: str                # Specific agent or bot ID
    confidence: float          # 0.0 to 1.0
    reasoning: List[str]       # Decision factors
    estimated_resolution_time: float  # Minutes
```

### Agent Management
```python
@dataclass
class Agent:
    specialties: List[str]     # Areas of expertise
    current_load: int         # Active tickets
    max_capacity: int         # Maximum concurrent tickets
    satisfaction_rating: float # Performance metric
```


```

## 📈 Usage Examples

### Basic Ticket Processing
```python
tix = Tix()

# Process a high-priority technical issue
ticket, routing = tix.process_ticket(
    subject="Production server down",
    content="Our main server is completely inaccessible. All services offline!",
    customer_id="enterprise_client",
    channel="phone"
)

# Tix automatically:
# - Detects CRITICAL priority
# - Identifies technical category  
# - Routes for immediate escalation
# - Estimates 30-minute resolution time
```

### Customer Service Integration
```python
class CustomerServiceBot:
    def __init__(self):
        self.tix = Tix()
        self.setup_agents()
    
    def handle_customer_message(self, message, customer_id):
        # Let Tix analyze and route
        ticket, routing = self.tix.process_ticket(
            subject="Customer inquiry",
            content=message,
            customer_id=customer_id,
            channel="chat"
        )
        
        if routing.decision == RoutingDecision.BOT_AUTOMATION:
            # Handle with automated response
            response = self.tix.generate_auto_response(ticket.id)
            return response
        elif routing.decision == RoutingDecision.HUMAN_SPECIALIST:
            # Route to best available agent
            self.assign_to_human(ticket, routing.target)
        elif routing.decision == RoutingDecision.ESCALATE:
            # Immediate escalation
            self.escalate_immediately(ticket)
```

### Analytics and Monitoring
```python
# Real-time dashboard data
dashboard = tix.get_dashboard_summary()
print(f"Open tickets: {dashboard['open_tickets']}")
print(f"Critical alerts: {dashboard['critical_tickets']}")
print(f"Agent utilization: {dashboard['agent_utilization']}")

# Detailed analytics
analytics = tix.get_ticket_analytics(days=30)
print(f"Resolution accuracy: {analytics['routing_accuracy']:.1%}")
print(f"Average processing time: {analytics['avg_processing_time']:.1f} min")

# Agent performance
workload = tix.get_agent_workload()
for agent_id, metrics in workload.items():
    print(f"{metrics['name']}: {metrics['utilization']:.1f}% utilized")
```

### Escalation Management
```python
# Automatic escalation detection
if ticket.priority == Priority.CRITICAL:
    tix.escalate_ticket(ticket.id, "Critical system outage detected")

# Manual escalation with reasoning
tix.escalate_ticket("TIX-20250804-A1B2C3", "VIP customer escalation requested")

# Escalation analytics
escalated_tickets = [t for t in tix.tickets.values() if t.escalation_reasons]
print(f"Escalation rate: {len(escalated_tickets)/len(tix.tickets)*100:.1f}%")
```

## 🔧 Configuration
